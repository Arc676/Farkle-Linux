"A 1 is worth 100 points A 5 is worth 50 points Three of the same number are "
"worth 100 times the number, except three 1s which are worth 1000 points "
"instead; these dice must come up on the same roll, not separate ones Each "
"additional occurrence of a number beyond the first three increases the value "
"of that set of dice by 100 times the number (the points obtained by rolling "
"three copies of that number) Players roll 6 dice and may select any subset "
"of those dice to score points. Those dice are removed from the pool and the "
"player may roll the remaining dice to score more points. If at any point "
"none of the rolled dice can score points, the turn is considered a <farkle> "
"and the player forfeits all their points from that turn. A player must "
"remove at least one scoring die from the pool to reroll. A player may choose "
"to stop rolling and <bank> any points they have already accumulated rather "
"than reroll. Note that the probability of farkling is greater if the pool is "
"smaller. If a player removes all 6 dice from the pool without farkling, that "
"player keeps all their points from that turn in hand, puts all 6 dice back "
"in the pool, and may reroll following the same rules as before."
